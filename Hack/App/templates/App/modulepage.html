      <div class="content">
        <h3>1.1 – Why should I invest?</h3>
        <p>
          Before we address the above question, let us understand what would
          happen if one chooses not to invest. Assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per
          month, and you spend Rs.30,000/- towards your day-to-day living;
          this can include expenses like housing, food, transport, shopping,
          medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly surplus.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the tax effect in this
          discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          To drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every
            year.
          </li>
          <li>The cost of living is likely to go up by 8% yearly.</li>
          <li>
            You are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50, this translates to
            20 working years.
          </li>
          <li>You don’t intend to work after you retire.</li>
          <li>
            Your expenses are fixed, and you don’t foresee any other expenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            The balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained as hard
            cash.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          If one were to analyze these numbers, one would soon realize this is
          a scary situation. A few things are quite obvious –
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>After 20 years of hard work, you have accumulated Rs.1.7Cr.</li>
          <li>
            Since your expenses are fixed, your lifestyle has not changed over
            the years, and you probably even suppressed your lifelong
            aspirations – a better home, car, vacations, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            After you retire, assuming the expenses will continue to grow at
            8%, the retirement corpus of Rs.1.7Cr is good enough to sail you
            through roughly 8 years of post-retirement life. 8th year onwards,
            you will be in a tight spot with literally no savings left to back
            you up.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What would you do after you run out of money in 8 years? How do you
          fund your life? Is there a way to ensure that you collect a more
          considerable sum at the end of 20 years?
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you may think that the assumptions are simple and
          that real life does not work like this. I agree, and I won’t dispute
          that fact. However, the point to note in the above calculation is
          that no investments are made, hence the cash retained has a flat or
          zero growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s consider another scenario where instead of keeping the cash
          idle, you choose to invest the cash in an investment option that
          grows at, let’s say, 12% per annum. For example – in the first year,
          you retained Rs.240,000/- which, when invested at 12% per annum for
          20 years (19 years assuming you invest at the end of 1st year),
          yields Rs.2,067,063/- at the end of the 20th year. For those
          interested in math, here is how that works –
        </p>
        <p>= 240000*(1+12%)^(19)</p>
        <p>= 2,067,063</p>
        <p>
          Don't worry about the math at this point. We will explain that later
          in this module (and several other modules in Varsity). Here is how
          the table looks if you choose to invest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your cash balance has increased significantly with the decision to
          invest surplus cash. The cash balance has grown to Rs.4.26Crs from
          Rs.1.7Crs, a staggering 2.4x more than earlier (when you choose not
          to invest). Clearly, with the decision to invest, you are in a much
          better situation to deal with your post-retirement life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, going back to the initial question of why invest? There are a
          few compelling reasons –
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fight Inflation</strong> – By investing, one can deal
            better with the inevitable reality of life – the growing cost of
            living – generally referred to as Inflation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Wealth</strong> – By investing, one can build a
            bigger corpus by the end of the target period. In the above
            example, the period was up to retirement, but it can be anything –
            children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement
            holidays, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better life</strong> – To meet life’s financial
            aspirations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>1.2 – Where to invest?</h3>
        <p>
          Having figured out the reasons to invest, the next obvious question
          is – where would one invest, and what return can one expect with
          investing? When investing, one has to choose an asset class that
          suits the individual’s risk and returns profile. For example, one
          individual will be open to taking a lot of risk with his or her
          money, while another may want to take moderate risk, while another
          would want zero risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of an asset class as an investment vehicle defined by its risk
          and return characteristics. The following are some of the popular
          asset classes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed income instruments</li>
          <li>Equity</li>
          <li>Real estate</li>
          <li>Commodities (precious metals)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 – Things to note before investing</h3>
        <p>
          Investing is an integral part of financial planning, but before you
          start your investment journey, it is good to be aware of the
          following –
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Risk and Return</strong> go hand in hand. Higher the risk,
            the higher the return. The lower the risk, the lower the return.
          </li>
          <li>
            Investment in <strong>fixed income</strong> is a good option if
            you want to protect your principal amount. It is relatively less
            risky. However, you have the risk of losing money when you adjust
            the inflation return. Example – A fixed deposit that gives you 9%
            when the inflation is 10% means you lose a net of 1% per annum.
            Alternatively, the risk increases if you invest in a corporate
            fixed-income instrument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Investment in <strong>Equities</strong> is a great option. It is
            known to beat inflation over a long period. Historically equity
            investment has generated returns close to 14-15%. However, equity
            investments can be risky.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Estate</strong> investment requires a significant
            outlay of cash and cannot be done with smaller amounts. Liquidity
            is another issue with real estate investment – you cannot buy or
            sell whenever you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gold and silver</strong> are relatively safer, but the
            historical return on such investment has not been very
            encouraging.
          </li>
        </ul>
